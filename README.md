It was tested on linux, mac, and windows and julia 1.11.5 (https://julialang.org/).

Use it at your own risk.


Software.pdf describes the code.



In case you want to try the software on other data:

I am happy to answer questions if you use the software on human data or data away from biology. 
For data from animals I do not want to participate in any way. Please respect life and be ethical! Animals have feelings and fears!
